# SpotifyCNCT - Spotify Connect CLI Remote

SpotifyCNCT will be a command line interface, written in go, that controls media playback over spotify connected devices using the [Spotify Web API](https://api.spotify.com). 

## Goals

- Display currently playing media in plain text for scripting purposes (polybar, conky, etc.)
- Control media playback (pause/play, next/previous song)
- Control volume of media playback
- Change options (shuffle/repeat)
- Seek options (fast forward, rewind)
- Control device selection
